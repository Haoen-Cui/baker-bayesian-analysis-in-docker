# Development Logs 

This file is a log of notes, mainly to remind myself in teh future. 

- To successfully execute `docker build`, the Docker Engine needs `CPU:4`, `Memory:6GB`, and `Swap:1GB`. This can be set in Docker Desktop > Preferences > Advanced. 
- It can take up to 2 hours to build the image, which is more than 7 GB 
- TODO: Run Jupyter Lab inside Docker
